<!-- LESSONS LEARNED -->
## Lessons Learned:
WOW, I learned a lot while tackling this dashboard. I'm React's newest fan, all the available packages make building so efficient and digestable. Some takeaways include:
- Nivo has some of the best charts I have ever seen and I love how you can customize the charts and see the update in real time in their documentation.
- Material UI is a game changer. This was my first time digging into MUI and it was very helpful to be able to create a custom theme color palette that could be referenced throughout the team. Passing a mode to select light or dark mode was really neat and definitely something I plan to incorporate in my future applications.
- FullCalendar made it sooo easy to build a customizable calendar. I expected to build the component from scratch but FullCalendar did all the heavy lifting.
